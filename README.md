# Re-learning the C language

In this repository I've decided to learn C again but this time; instead of just learning the basics,
I want learn
* how C is implemeted
* how some functions were created, so that I can make replicas of them in order to understand them better.
* how C can be applied to solve problems encountered in our day to day lives.

I've decided to document this so that I can make myself accountable.

So here we go!!!
